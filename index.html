            <p>A tsunami occurs when there is a sudden and massive disturbance underwater, such as an undersea earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, or even a meteor impact. These events displace a large volume of water, causing powerful waves to spread across the ocean at high speeds. As these waves approach the shore, they build up in height and energy, resulting in the potentially devastating impact when they hit coastal areas.</p>

                <p>Tsunamis can cause catastrophic impacts, including large-scale loss of life and injuries, extensive damage to property and infrastructure, and severe economic consequences. They also disrupt communities, displace people, and create public health concerns. The environmental effects are significant, as tsunamis can destroy coastal ecosystems and pollute habitats. Survivors often experience long-lasting psychological trauma. The combined effect of these impacts makes tsunamis one of the most devastating natural disasters.</p>
